# Geometric Shapes Calculator - AICP Week 4 Challenge

This repository contains the Python code for the Advanced Interactive Coding Program (AICP) Week 4 challenge. The task involves creating classes for a hexagon and a square, where we calculate and display their geometric properties based on user input.

## Project Description

The project consists of two main classes: `Hexagon` and `Square`. Each class has methods to calculate the area, perimeter (and for Hexagon, the angle sum), and a method to display these values.

### Features

- Calculates the area, perimeter, and sum of angles for a hexagon.
- Calculates the area and perimeter for a square.
- User input for CNIC number to determine the dimensions.
- Interactive console menu for user interaction.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the script using Python 3.
3. Enter your CNIC number when prompted.
4. Choose the shape you want to calculate properties for.

### Code Structure

- `Hexagon` class: Handles calculations related to the hexagon.
- `Square` class: Handles calculations related to the square.
- `main` function: Orchestrates user input and displays results.
